# Components done right™

This package contains the code example used for the [Components done right™](../../talks/2018/Components_Done_Right.md) talk at ReactiveMeetups.

It contains of a list that renders trending books where each book has a title, an author and a star-based rating.

Both the book list and the ratings are fetched from different APIs, in this case (for the sake of simplicity), some local static JSON files.

## Installation

```sh
# yarn
yarn

# npm
npm i
```

## Demo

To start the demo you may run the Next.js server using:

```sh
# yarn
yarn start

# npm
npm start
```

The example should now be visible at http://localhost:3000.

## Navigating

As the example was modified during the talk in form of live coding, we might want to navigate through the different phases.<br>
To do so, please check the different commits modifying the example code as each commit represents a new refactoring.
