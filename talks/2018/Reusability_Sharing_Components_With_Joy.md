### Abstract

Reusability is often listed as one of the core benefits of component-based architectures.
While in theory itâ€™s pretty straight-forward, in practice, writing truly reusable components is way more complicated. How do we customise styling? how to render to non-browser environments? There are all valid questions and issues with current solutions. But, following some rules and patterns can help to minify the problems.
Follow me along my quest to achieve maximal reusability and delightful component sharing.
